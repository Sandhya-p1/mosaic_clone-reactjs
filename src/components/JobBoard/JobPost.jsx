            In the world of AI, behavioural predictions are leading the charge
            to better machine learning.
            <br />
            <br />
            There is so much happening in the AI space. Advances in the economic
            sectors have seen automated business practices rapidly increasing
            economic value. While the realm of the human sciences has used the
            power afforded by computational capabilities to solve many human
            based dilemmas. Even the art scene has adopted carefully selected ML
            applications to usher in the technological movement.
            <br />
            <br />
            Join us every second Wednesday as we host an open discussion about
            the amazing things happening in the world of AI and machine
            learning. Feel free to share your experiences, ask questions, ponder
            the possibilities, or just listen as we explore new topics and
            revisit old ones.

          <h1 className="font-bold text-black text-xl">About You</h1>
          <p>
            You love building great software. Your work could be supporting new
            feature development, migrating existing features, and creating other
            mobile and web solutions for customers. You'll have a primary focus
            on frontend development using Javascript. Our client's tech stack is
            JavaScript, primarily using React. A strong understanding of JS core
            (ES2019+) is required, with some exposure in Java as back-end
            technology. We use modern tools, which means you'll have the
            opportunity to work with Webpack, Redux, Apollo, Styled Components,
            and much more.
            <br />
            <br />
            You love learning. Engineering is an ever-evolving world. You enjoy
            playing with new tech and exploring areas that you might not have
            experience with yet. You are self-driven, self-learner willing to
            share knowledge and participate actively in your community.
            <br />
            <br />
            Having overlap with your team is critical when working in a global
            remote team. Modus requires all team members to overlap with EST
            morning hours daily. In addition, reliable high speed internet is a
            must.

          <p>
            We are a fast-growing, and remote-first company, so you'll likely
            get experience on many different projects across the organization.
            That said, here are some things you'll probably do:
          </p>
          <br />
          <li>Give back to the community via open source and blog posts</li>
          <li>
            Travel and meet great people- as part of our remote-first lifestyle,
            it's important that we come together as needed to work together,
            meet each other in person and have fun together. Please keep that in
            mind when you apply.
          </li>
          <li>
            Teach and be taught: Modus creates active teams that work in
            internal and external projects together, giving opportunities to
            stay relevant with the latest technologies and learning from experts
            worldwide
          </li>
